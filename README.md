## Story ##

You just woke up in an empty diner. It's quiet, you're alone, and the door won't budge. You've tried breaking the door and the windows, but nothing has worked. However, you notice that there are sublte hints around the diner. Navigate through the hints one by one, and escape the diner!

## Objective ##

Your goal is to go through the entire room, navigating from one clue to the next, until you reach the final clue and be able to exit. Each clue will give you a hint to the next one, with the first clue being given to you. There are a total of 9 clues.

  <summary>Solution: Spoiler warning</summary>
  
  *  Clue 1: The given clue is "Take a seat!" Examine the stools in front of the tall table. The leftmost stool has a small piece of paper underneath it. Clicking the stool will move the stool, and clicking the note will reveal the next clue. 
  *  Clue 2: The note underneath the stools says "Time to order! Let's see what's offered here...". Each table on a booth has a menu standing up on it. However, only one menu (the second from the Jukebox) will open when you click it. Clicking this particular menu will get you to the next clue.
  *  Clue 3: The menu reads "While waiting for your food, why don't you check out some of the art?" Observe the four circular posters between the jukebox and the glass door. Cliking on the mimosa (Original Orange), coffee (Dreamy Cafe Latte), and martini (After Dark) posters will not lead to anything, but clicking the Coke poster will change the poster. This new poster will contain your next clue.
  *  Clue 4:   
  *  Clue 5:
